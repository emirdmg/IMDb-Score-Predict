Readme for the Linear Regression Model on Ratings Dataset
Introduction
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the process of applying a Linear Regression model to a dataset of ratings. The purpose of this project is to predict the rating based on various features using the Linear Regression technique, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning for regression problems.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, named ratings.csv, consists of multiple columns where each row represents a unique rating event. The specific details of the columns such as their names and types are not detailed here but generally include user IDs, ratings, and other features that could influence a rating.

Conclusion
This project serves as a basic introduction to applying Linear Regression to a ratings dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. Users are encouraged to extend this project by incorporating more sophisticated feature engineering, using different regression models, and implementing model evaluation metrics to assess performance.
